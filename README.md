# Advanced Speech Detector

This project is an advanced speech detection system built with Python. It can recognize spoken words, transcribe them into text, and perform specific actions based on detected keywords or phrases. The project is designed to work in real-time and can be easily extended with custom commands.

## Features

- **Speech Recognition**: Converts spoken words into text using Google's Speech Recognition API.
- **Keyword Detection**: Recognizes specific keywords and triggers corresponding actions.
- **Real-time Processing**: Continuously listens to and processes speech input with minimal delay.
- **Customizable Commands**: Users can define their own commands and associated actions.

## Requirements

To run this project, you'll need to have Python installed along with the following libraries:

- `SpeechRecognition`
- `PyAudio`
- `os` (comes pre-installed with Python)
- `time` (comes pre-installed with Python)

### Installation

1. **Clone the Repository**:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/advanced-speech-detector.git
   cd advanced-speech-detector
Install Dependencies: Make sure you have Python installed. Then, install the required Python packages using pip:

bash
Copy code
pip install SpeechRecognition pyaudio
Run the Script: You can start the speech detector by running the Python script:

bash
Copy code
python advanced_speech_detector.py
How to Use
Once you run the script, the program will start listening to your microphone input. It will recognize and transcribe any speech it hears. If certain keywords are detected in your speech, the program will perform specific actions.

Example Commands:
"Hello": The program will greet you back.
"Open Notepad": The program will open Notepad on your computer.
"What is your name?": The program will introduce itself.
"Time": The program will tell you the current time.
Customizing Commands
You can customize the commands and actions by modifying the perform_action_based_on_keyword() function in the script. Add new elif statements for additional commands, and define the actions you want the program to take.

Example:

python
Copy code
elif "your custom command" in transcription.lower():
    # Define the action for your custom command
    print("Custom action executed.")
Troubleshooting
If the program isn't recognizing your speech correctly:

Ensure that your microphone is working properly.
Try speaking more clearly or adjusting the microphone's sensitivity by modifying the recognizer.adjust_for_ambient_noise() function.
Check your internet connection, as the Google Speech Recognition API requires it to process speech.
